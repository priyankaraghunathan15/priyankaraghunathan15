## Hey, I'm Priyanka! 👋

I turn messy data into **$36M business decisions**. 

Currently pursuing my MS in Data Science at Northeastern, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data. My work has helped companies optimize everything from marketing campaigns to healthcare outcomes.

### 💡 What Drives Me
I believe data science isn't just about algorithms—it's about impact. Whether I'm segmenting 30 million customer records or predicting patient readmissions, I focus on solutions that matter.

### 🎯 Recent Wins
- **Saved a company $500K** by proving their marketing campaigns weren't working (through rigorous A/B testing)
- **Increased customer walk-ins by 45%** by identifying the right promotional strategy during festive seasons  
- **Cut reporting time by 40%** because analysts shouldn't spend their days copy-pasting data
- **Predicted hospital readmissions with 94% accuracy**, helping healthcare providers identify at-risk patients early

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here
My repositories showcase everything from healthcare prediction models to supply chain optimization dashboards. Each project tells a story of a problem solved, not just code written.

### 🌟 Beyond the Code
I'm a Microsoft-certified Power BI analyst who believes in making data accessible to everyone. When I'm not debugging models, you'll find me exploring Boston or diving into the latest ML papers.
