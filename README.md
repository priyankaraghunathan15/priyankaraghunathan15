## Hey, I'm Priyanka! 👋

I turn messy data into **$36M business decisions**. 

Currently pursuing my MS in Data Science at Northeastern, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data. My work has helped companies optimize everything from marketing campaigns to customer experiences.

### 💡 What Drives Me
I believe data science isn't just about algorithms-it's about impact. Whether I'm segmenting 30 million customer records or building predictive models, I focus on solutions that matter.

### 🎯 Professional Impact
- **Saved a company $500K** by proving their marketing campaigns weren't working (through rigorous A/B testing)
- **Drove $36M in incremental revenue** through targeted customer segmentation and personalized campaigns
- **Increased customer walk-ins by 45%** by identifying the right promotional strategy during festive seasons  
- **Cut reporting time by 40%** because analysts shouldn't spend their days copy-pasting data
- **Improved campaign conversions by 20%** using XGBoost propensity models for audience targeting

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here
My repositories showcase academic projects and personal explorations from healthcare prediction models to supply chain dashboards. While these are learning projects, each one reflects my approach to problem-solving and clean code.

### 🌟 Beyond the Code
I'm a Microsoft-certified Power BI analyst who believes in making data accessible to everyone. When I'm not debugging models, you'll find me exploring Boston or diving into the latest ML papers.
